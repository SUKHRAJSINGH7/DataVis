    <h1>Exploring the Impact of Cost on Higher Education</h1>
    <h2>By Sukhraj Singh</h2>

    <p>
      This project explores how the rising cost of higher education in the
      United States is affecting students and society. Using interactive data
      visualizations, we examine tuition trends, enrollment shifts,
      post-graduation debt, and the economic return on different degrees. The
      goal is to tell a data-driven story about the growing burden of college
      costs and the limited financial outcomes for many graduates.

    <!-- Tuition Growth -->
    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Tuition Growth Over Time (All Institutions)</h2>
      <p>
        The cost of attending college in the United States has exploded over the
        last 60 years. In the early 1960s, average annual tuition at all
        institutions was just over $1,200. Today, that number has soared past
        $27,000. This chart shows just how steep and unrelenting that climb has
        been. While inflation plays a role, tuition has increased at a rate far
        beyond general cost-of-living adjustments, outpacing wage growth,
        housing, and even healthcare. For many families, affording college
        without borrowing is no longer possible. What was once a manageable
        expense has now become one of the largest financial commitments a person
        can take on before age 20.

    <!-- Student Debt -->
    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Student Debt Over Time (Undergraduate vs Graduate)</h2>
      <p>
        As tuition climbed, so did borrowing. This chart breaks down how student
        debt has grown over time — not just in total, but split between
        undergraduate and graduate borrowers. Undergraduate debt has steadily
        risen, but graduate debt is increasing at an even faster pace,
        especially as students pursue high-cost degrees like law, business, or
        medicine. These are not just bigger numbers — they represent people
        entering adulthood tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
        red. For many, debt now stretches well into their 30s and beyond,
        shaping decisions about careers, housing, and family planning.

    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Breakdown of Average American Debt</h2>
      <p>
        Student loans are no longer just a temporary hurdle — they’ve become a
        defining part of the American debt profile. This chart breaks down the
        average American’s total debt by category, from mortgages to credit
        cards. Student loans now sit alongside the biggest liabilities most
        people carry in their lives. What makes student debt different is
        timing. Most borrowers take it on before their first full-time job, long
        before buying a house or a car. And unlike other forms of debt, student
        loans often don’t come with assets — just a degree, which may or may not
        pay off. For a growing number of people, this is the first major
        financial commitment they make — and it lingers for decades.

    <!-- Cost of Living -->
    <div class="chart-section">
      <h2>Cost of Living Index by State (2025)</h2>
      <p>
        Student debt doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it plays out differently
        depending on where you live. This map shows the cost of living index by
        state, highlighting how far your money actually goes after graduation.
        In high-cost states like California, Massachusetts, or New York, even a
        solid salary can feel tight once you factor in rent, groceries, and
        healthcare. The same student loan payment feels heavier when everything
        else around it costs more too. On the other hand, states with lower
        living costs may offer more breathing room, but often come with fewer
        job opportunities in high-paying sectors. The reality is that geography
        now plays a major role in how manageable — or unmanageable — student
        debt becomes.

      <h2>College Enrollment Trends Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        For decades, college enrollment in the U.S. climbed steadily. But that
        growth has now stalled — and in recent years, it’s started to reverse.
        This chart shows the slow but clear decline in the number of students
        enrolling in college. The reasons are layered: rising tuition, fear of
        lifelong debt, and growing skepticism about whether a degree truly
        guarantees better opportunities. For many, the risk-reward equation of
        higher education has changed. More students are now questioning whether
        college is worth it — and increasingly, they’re deciding it’s not.
