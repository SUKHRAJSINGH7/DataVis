    <h1>Exploring the Impact of Cost on Higher Education</h1>
    <h2>By Sukhraj Singh</h2>

    <p>
      This project explores how the rising cost of higher education in the
      United States is affecting students and society. Using interactive data
      visualizations, we examine tuition trends, enrollment shifts,
      post-graduation debt, and the economic return on different degrees. The
      goal is to tell a data-driven story about the growing burden of college
      costs and the limited financial outcomes for many graduates.
    </p>

    <!-- Tuition Growth Over Time -->
    <h2>Tuition Growth Over Time (All Institutions)</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past six decades, the cost of attending college in the United
      States has increased dramatically. This chart shows a long-term view of
      <strong>tuition growth</strong>, revealing a consistent rise that outpaces
      inflation and wage growth. This rise is the root cause of much of the
      downstream pressure now seen across society.

    <!-- Student Debt Bar Chart -->
    <h2>Student Debt Over Time (Undergraduate vs Graduate)</h2>
    <p>
      With costs rising, students have turned to borrowing. The chart below
      shows the growth of
      <strong>undergraduate and graduate student debt</strong>
      over the past two decades. Graduate debt is rising especially fast, driven
      by expensive programs like law, business, and medicine.

    <!-- American Debt Donut -->
    <h2>Breakdown of Average American Debt</h2>
    <p>
      Student loans are now a major part of household debt. This donut chart
      shows how <strong>student debt compares</strong> to other forms like
      mortgages, auto loans, and credit card balances — pushing the average
      American’s total debt above $100,000.

    <!-- Cost of Living Map -->
    <h2>Cost of Living Index by State (2025)</h2>
    <p>
      Debt hits harder depending on where you live. This map shows the
      <strong>cost of living index by state</strong> for 2025. In expensive
      states like California or New York, even high post-grad salaries don’t go
      as far, while lower-cost states may offer more room — but fewer economic
      opportunities.

    <!-- College Enrollment Chart (scroll animated) -->
    <h2>College Enrollment Trends Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      The effect of rising tuition is now starting to show up in
      <strong>enrollment rates</strong>. For the first time in decades, college
      enrollment is falling. This drop reflects how many are reconsidering
      whether the cost of college is worth it at all.
