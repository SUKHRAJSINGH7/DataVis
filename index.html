            This project explores how the rising cost of higher education in the
            United States is affecting students and society. Using interactive
            data visualizations, we examine tuition trends, enrollment shifts,
            post-graduation debt, and the economic return on different degrees.

          <h3>Tuition Growth Over Time</h3>
          <p>
            The cost of attending college in the United States has exploded over
            the last 60 years. In the early 1960s, average annual tuition at all
            institutions was just over $1,200. Today, that number has soared
            past $27,000. This chart shows just how steep and unrelenting that
            climb has been. While inflation plays a role, tuition has increased
            at a rate far beyond general cost-of-living adjustments, outpacing
            wage growth, housing, and even healthcare. For many families,
            affording college without borrowing is no longer possible. What was
            once a manageable expense has now become one of the largest
            financial commitments a person can take on before age 20.

          <h3>Student Debt Over Time (Undergraduate vs Graduate)</h3>
          <p>
            As tuition climbed, so did borrowing. This chart breaks down how
            student debt has grown over time — not just in total, but split
            between undergraduate and graduate borrowers. Undergraduate debt has
            steadily risen, but graduate debt is increasing at an even faster
            pace, especially as students pursue high-cost degrees like law,
            business, or medicine. These are not just bigger numbers — they
            represent people entering adulthood tens or even hundreds of
            thousands of dollars in the red. For many, debt now stretches well
            into their 30s and beyond, shaping decisions about careers, housing,
            and family planning.

          <h3>Breakdown of Average American Debt</h3>
          <p>
            Student loans are no longer just a temporary hurdle — they’ve become
            a defining part of the American debt profile. This chart breaks down
            the average American’s total debt by category, from mortgages to
            credit cards. Student loans now sit alongside the biggest
            liabilities most people carry in their lives. What makes student
            debt different is timing. Most borrowers take it on before their
            first full-time job, long before buying a house or a car. And unlike
            other forms of debt, student loans often don’t come with assets —
            just a degree, which may or may not pay off. For a growing number of
            people, this is the first major financial commitment they make — and
            it lingers for decades.

          <p>
            Student debt doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it plays out differently
            depending on where you live. This map shows the cost of living index
            by state, highlighting how far your money actually goes after
            graduation. In high-cost states like California, Massachusetts, or
            New York, even a solid salary can feel tight once you factor in
            rent, groceries, and healthcare. The same student loan payment feels
            heavier when everything else around it costs more too. On the other
            hand, states with lower living costs may offer more breathing room,
            but often come with fewer job opportunities in high-paying sectors.
            The reality is that geography now plays a major role in how
            manageable — or unmanageable — student debt becomes..

          <h3>College Enrollment Trends Over Time</h3>
          <p>
            For decades, college enrollment in the U.S. climbed steadily. But
            that growth has now stalled — and in recent years, it’s started to
            reverse. This chart shows the slow but clear decline in the number
            of students enrolling in college. The reasons are layered: rising
            tuition, fear of lifelong debt, and growing skepticism about whether
            a degree truly guarantees better opportunities. For many, the
            risk-reward equation of higher education has changed. More students
            are now questioning whether college is worth it — and increasingly,
            they’re deciding it’s not.

            Student debt impacts financial independence and long-term stability.
            This chart breaks down homeownership rates by age group as of 2025.
            Younger Americans—especially those under 35—are significantly less
            likely to own homes. The financial strain from rising tuition costs
            and student loans delays key milestones like buying a house,
            starting a family, or saving for retirement. These delays aren't
            just temporary setbacks—they contribute to long-term disparities in
            wealth and security between generations, with younger adults falling
            further behind.
