  <h1>Exploring the Impact of Cost on Higher Education</h1>
  <h2>By Sukhraj Singh</h2>

  <p>
    This project explores how the rising cost of higher education in the United States is affecting students and society. 
    Using interactive data visualizations, we examine tuition trends, enrollment shifts, post-graduation debt, and 
    the economic return on different degrees. The goal is to tell a data-driven story about the growing burden of college 
    costs and the limited financial outcomes for many graduates.
  </p>

  <p>
    As costs continue to climb, students are being forced to weigh the value of education against long-term debt 
    and underwhelming job prospects. This site helps break down those numbers in a visual, interactive way.
